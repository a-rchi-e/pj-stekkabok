# Solo project

Finally the time has come to put together everything you learned in the junior part! Once your proposal has been reviewed and approved by an instructor, you can dive into your solo project! ðŸš€

Before you continue reading, spend a few mintues going through the general [project-tips](https://github.com/codeworks/students-handbook/wiki/Projects-tips) in the student handbook if you havenâ€™t seen them already.

Remember that it is advisable to plan ahead of time, but the actual project must be built within a week. If you start coding during the break, your tutor may refuse your proposal, no cheating!

## Getting started

Here are some tips and suggestions to help you get the project up and running as smoothly as possible. Reach out to your classmates and your instructors if you need further advice. Even if we call it "solo" project, youâ€™re not alone in this!

### Design process

1. Whether youâ€™re building a full stack app, an npm package, a CLI tool or something else, start by sketching out your application in a notebook or a whiteboard. This high-level overview will help you define the different parts of the app and their responsibilities. At this point, you shouldnâ€™t be thinking in code. Plain logic and common sense is all you need to set up a basic diagram/skeleton for your app. [This great post](https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/visualize-code-documentation) will also help you get started. Here are some tools that you can use:
- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)
- [Uizard](https://uizard.io/)
- [Figma](https://excalidraw.com/).
2. Once youâ€™ve passed this stage, you are ready to think in terms of the modules/components that make up the parts of your application and organize them in files and folders.
3. At an even lower level, you will go into these modules/components and start writing the code to implement their functionality. You might split these parts into even smaller, simpler and more manageable parts to keep things simple. Remember: complexity is your enemy. Whatever reduces complexity, makes your life easier and reduces the possibility of introducing bugs, security issues and unintended side-effects.
4. Get to know your data. If youâ€™re planning to take data from an API, check that it provides the data in a way that is useful to you or look for other options (you donâ€™t want to start building and then discover the data you rely on doesnâ€™t work with your set up).

### Database

Create a diagram of your database (entities, relationships, table or document structure). It will help us review the database design and schemas and it will help you go from these ERD diagram straight into code. Here are some tools that you can use:
- [DB Designer](https://app.dbdesigner.net/)
- [sqlDBM](https://app.sqldbm.com/)
- [Lucidchart](https://lucidchart.com/pages/)

### Stack

We advise you to use libraries/frameworks/technologies that have been covered in the lectures. Strengthen your skills on these technologies and let us help and support you in the most efficient manner. If you feel adventurous, you may pick a new CSS library or third-party components, but switching to a stack that is completely different from the course is not recommended.

When picking a third-party module, library, plugin, or npm package, make sure to check:
- Stars (prefer repos with at least a two-digit number of stars, but there are rare cases of small handy utilities with fewer stars)
- Last update date (donâ€™t pick deprecated or outdated/outlived packages)
- Carefully read the documentation and study the examples
- Research issues or problems that might arise when combining the package/library with other technologies you are using.
    
### Productivity

Share insights and information about common technologies with your fellow students. For example, you might want to share information about geolocation or some maps API in case some of you want to integrate the same technology into your apps.

### UI/UX

You can spice up your UI with beautiful free stock photos from:
- [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
Or cool illustrations from: [Undraw](https://undraw.co/)
And even some awesome animations available from: [https://lottiefiles.com](https://lottiefiles.com/)

### Performance

You can use a Tool like [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac) (Mac) or [Bamboo](https://christopherwk210.github.io/bamboo/), or a free service like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) to decrease the file size of your images.

### Insights

Last, but not least, here are some words of wisdom from our students:

- EVERYTHING takes longer than expected
- Have a detailed step-by-step plan 
- Wireframes and mockups are your friends
- Ask for help
